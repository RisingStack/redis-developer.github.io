# redis-sitesearch

## About

redis-sitesearch is a package that indexes web sites into RediSearch.

&lt;img src&#x3D;&quot;images/redisearch.png&quot; width&#x3D;&quot;200&quot;&gt;

RediSearch is a querying and indexing engine for Redis that supports full-text search. You can read more about it here: https://oss.redislabs.com/redisearch/

redis-sitesearch was originally developed by Redis Labs to provide a search API for our documentation. You can see it live at: https://docs.redislabs.com.

## Installing

The development environment is provided as a Docker container. Running and deploying it all involve using Docker, and this section describes how to do so.

**Note**: If you desire not to use Docker, you can reverse-engineer the installation steps from the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file.

### Docker Requirements

This project was built and tested using the following Docker and docker-compose versions:

Docker version 19.03.13, build 4484c46d9d
docker-compose version 1.27.4, build 40524192

Ensure you are running at least these versions before you continue.

### .env files

The app is configured using environment variables, so you&#x27;ll need two different &#x60;.env&#x60; files depending on what you want to do:

- &#x60;.env&#x60;: Environment variables for local development
- &#x60;.env.prod&#x60;: Environment variables to deploy to production

Examples are included, which you can copy from &#x60;.env.example&#x60; to &#x60;.env&#x60; and from &#x60;.env.prod.example&#x60; to &#x60;.env.prod&#x60;.

### Redis Passwords

This application expects to use a password to authenticate with Redis. Both .env.prod.example and .env.example include the environment variable &#x60;REDIS_PASSWORD&#x60;.

In local development, running &#x60;docker-compose up&#x60; will start Redis in password-required mode with the password you set in the &#x60;REDIS_PASSWORD&#x60; environment variable from the &#x60;.env&#x60; file.

In production, the app will use the password from the &#x60;.env.prod&#x60; file.

### Virtualenv

If you want code completion to work in an IDE, or you want to run commands outside of Docker (like &#x60;pytest&#x60;), create a virtualenv:

        python 3.8 -m venv env

Then you can run the following to activate your virtualenv:

        source env/bin/activate

**Note**: This project was built with and is only tested to work on Python 3.8.

### Run docker-compose up

After you have the necessary Docker software, &quot;install&quot; the app with &#x60;docker-compose&#x60;:

        docker-compose up --build

This command builds the necessary images and brings up the app.

### Indexing Documents

As soon as the app finishes starting up, it begins indexing site content.

You should see output like this, indicating that supervisor started the processes:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
app_1   | 2021-01-12 21:17:51,091 INFO success: worker entered RUNNING state, process has stayed up for &gt; than 1 seconds (startsecs)
app_1   | 2021-01-12 21:17:51,092 INFO success: app entered RUNNING state, process has stayed up for &gt; than 1 seconds (startsecs)
app_1   | 2021-01-12 21:17:51,093 INFO success: redis entered RUNNING state, process has stayed up for &gt; than 1 seconds (startsecs)
app_1   | 2021-01-12 21:17:51,095 INFO success: scheduler entered RUNNING state, process has stayed up for &gt; than 1 seconds (startsecs)
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

* The &quot;app&quot; process is the Python search API
* The &quot;worker&quot; process is an RQ worker that will process any indexing tasks it sees
* The &quot;scheduler&quot; worker is a process that runs an indexing task every 60 minutes

You might see errors and warnings as the indexing job proceeds, like this:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
app_1   | 2021-01-12 21:18:07 [sitesearch.indexer] ERROR: Document parser error -- Could not find breadcrumbs: https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/
app_1   | 2021-01-12 21:18:08 [sitesearch.indexer] ERROR: Document parser error -- Skipping 404 page: https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/404.html
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

This output is usually normal -- some pages don&#x27;t have breadcrumbs, and we skip 404 pages.

### New Relic

The Python app tries to use New Relic. If you don&#x27;t specify a valid NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable in your .env or .env.prod files, the New Relic Agent will log errors. This is ok -- the app will continue to function without New Relic.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
app_1   | 2021-01-12 22:36:16,867 (61/NR-Activate-Session/sitesearch) newrelic.core.agent_protocol CRITICAL - Disconnection of the agent has been requested by the data collector for the application where the agent run was None. Please contact New Relic support for further information.
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## Searching

The app maps localhost port 8080 to the search API. After you start the app with &#x60;docker-compose up&#x60;, can search using this URL:

        localhost:8080/search?q&#x3D;&lt;your search terms&gt;

For example:

        $ curl localhost:8080/search?q&#x3D;redis

Every response includes the total number of hits and a configurable number of results.

## Developing

Assuming you have already brought up the app with &#x60;docker-compose up&#x60; per the installation instructions, this section describes things to know about for local development.

### Writing Code

Once the application is running, you can write code using a local text editor, and your changes will sync to the container over a volume mount.

The WSGI server running the app is set to reload when code changes, so if you have &#x60;docker-compose up&#x60; running (so you can see output), and you change code in the project, you will see output about workers being &quot;reaped.&quot;

This is well and good -- they are restarting.

### Tests

To run tests, use this command:

        docker-compose run test

This runs &#x60;pytest&#x60; within the container.

If you have a &#x60;.env&#x60; file, you can run &#x60;pytest&#x60; locally (after you&#x27;ve activated your virtualenv), and the tests will pick up the necessary environment variables from your &#x60;.env&#x60; file.

### Local vs. Docker redis

The redis instance that this project&#x27;s container starts exposes the default redis port locally (6379). So, after you run &#x60;docker-compose up&#x60; you can connect to redis outside of the Docker container on that port.

However, note that this won&#x27;t work if you&#x27;re already running redis locally on the default port -- so make sure you stop that if you want to connect to the redis running on Docker.

## Deploying

This project includes a deployment script for Google Cloud Platform that is specific to Redis Labs&#x27; deployment.

If you want to use this script to deploy, follow these steps:

1. Install the [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk)
2. Authenticate and select the appropriate project (ask Education for access!)
3. Make sure you have a &#x60;.env.prod&#x60; file -- this is important, and deploying will fail without it
4. Make sure you&#x27;ve committed your local changes
5. Run the deployment script: &#x60;./deploy.sh&#x60;

The deployment script does the following:

1. Builds a new image based on the code in your working directory, which includes the git hash as part of the tag
2. Pushes the image to Google Container Registry
3. Creates a new instance template using the image and the contents of your .env.prod -- all env vars there will be sent to containers run from that template
4. Starts a rolling update in our production regions: US-West (us-west-1a), Mumbai (asia-south-1c), and Zurich (europe-west6-a)

When the rolling update completes, the script will terminate.

However, the rolling update is not technically complete. Each search node will reindex as it comes online, and the new node&#x27;s health check will only succeed once that completes, in about **20 minutes**.

Until the update completes, the past version of the search service remains available.
